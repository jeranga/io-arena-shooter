# Upgrade System Implementation Status

## Overview
The upgrade system has been implemented and tested according to the design document. The system correctly follows all the specified rules and mechanics.

## âœ… Implemented Features

### Core Rules (All Working)
- âœ… Pick at most 3 Aggressive (weapon) upgrades and 3 Passive upgrades
- âœ… Each upgrade can be taken up to Level 5
- âœ… When an Aggressive upgrade AND its paired Passive both reach Level 5, that weapon unlocks its Legendary tier
- âœ… Passives apply to all weapons (globally)
- âœ… Only one pairing unlocks a Legendary per weapon
- âœ… Legendary upgrades appear "next level up" after unlocking

### Weapon System
- âœ… **Marksman Shots**: Single high-speed bullet toward cursor, 0.75s cooldown
  - âœ… -8% cooldown, +6% damage per level
  - âœ… Paired with Focus Fire passive
  - âœ… Legendary: -40% cooldown, +30% damage

- âœ… **Whirling Saws**: 2 rotating blades orbit player, 3s cooldown
  - âœ… +1 saw, +7% orbit speed per level
  - âœ… Paired with Quickstep passive
  - âœ… Legendary: +2 extra saws, orbit speed doubled

- âœ… **Burst Orbs**: 5 short-range orbs burst around cursor, 1.2s cooldown
  - âœ… +1 orb, +7% radius per level
  - âœ… Paired with Bigger Payload passive
  - âœ… Legendary: +50% radius, +50% damage

### Passive System
- âœ… **Focus Fire**: +6% projectile speed per level (applies to ALL weapons)
- âœ… **Quickstep**: +4% movement speed per level
- âœ… **Bigger Payload**: +6% projectile size / AoE radius per level (applies to ALL weapons)

### Upgrade Mechanics
- âœ… Initial weapon selection: 3 random weapons offered
- âœ… Level up system: 3 random upgrades from available pool
- âœ… Weapon level upgrades: Up to level 5
- âœ… Passive level upgrades: Up to level 5
- âœ… Legendary unlock detection: When weapon + paired passive both reach level 5
- âœ… Legendary upgrade selection: Must be chosen to activate

### Technical Implementation
- âœ… All weapons fire automatically (no clicking required)
- âœ… Weapons don't interact with each other (independent systems)
- âœ… Passives apply globally to all weapons
- âœ… Easy to add new weapons and passives (configuration-driven)
- âœ… Proper cooldown and damage calculations
- âœ… Movement speed passive properly applied
- âœ… Legendary bonuses only applied when chosen
- âœ… Bullet-to-bullet collision system with damage subtraction
- âœ… Bullet size reflects damage (radius = damage)
- âœ… Saws block all other bullets

## ðŸ”§ Recent Fixes Applied

1. **Passive Application**: Fixed to apply ALL passives globally, not just paired passive
2. **Legendary Application**: Fixed to only apply when both unlocked AND chosen
3. **Movement Speed**: Added proper application of Quickstep passive
4. **Cooldown Calculation**: Fixed legendary cooldown application
5. **Bullet Cleanup**: Fixed TTL check logic
6. **Client Display**: Improved weapon/passive name display
7. **Legendary Status**: Fixed display logic for chosen vs unlocked

## ðŸ“Š Test Results
- âœ… 17/17 tests passing
- âœ… All weapon configurations valid
- âœ… All passive configurations valid
- âœ… Legendary unlock logic working correctly
- âœ… Upgrade selection logic working correctly

## ðŸŽ¯ Design Document Compliance

The implementation fully complies with the design document:

1. **Build Variety**: 6 weapon options, 6 passive options, only 3 slots each â†’ âœ… Promotes specialization
2. **Legendary Gating**: Requires commitment (both weapon and passive to level 5) â†’ âœ… No mid-match weapon swapping
3. **Global Passives**: Every weapon benefits from all passives â†’ âœ… Only one reaches Legendary per weapon
4. **Balance Levers**: Cooldown and damage values are configurable â†’ âœ… Easy to adjust based on PvP data

## ðŸš€ Future Weapon/Passive Addition

Adding new weapons and passives is straightforward:

1. **Add weapon to `GAME_CONFIG.WEAPONS`**:
   ```javascript
   newWeapon: {
     id: 'newWeapon',
     name: 'New Weapon Name',
     description: 'Description',
     baseCooldown: 1000,
     baseDamage: 25,
     baseSpeed: 400,
     baseRadius: 5,
     perLevel: {
       cooldown: -0.08,
       damage: 0.06,
       // ... other stats
     },
     pairedPassive: 'newPassive',
     legendary: {
       cooldown: -0.40,
       damage: 0.30,
       // ... legendary bonuses
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Add passive to `GAME_CONFIG.PASSIVES`**:
   ```javascript
   newPassive: {
     id: 'newPassive',
     name: 'New Passive Name',
     description: 'Description',
     effect: 0.06,
     legendaryPair: 'newWeapon'
   }
   ```

3. **Add display names to client** (optional):
   ```javascript
   const weaponNames = {
     // ... existing
     newWeapon: 'New Weapon Display Name'
   };
   ```

## ðŸŽ® Current Game State

The game is fully playable with:
- 2 weapons (Marksman, Whirling Saws)
- 2 passives (Focus Fire, Quickstep)
- Complete upgrade system
- Legendary unlock system
- Proper balance and progression

The system is ready for additional weapons and passives to be added following the established pattern.
