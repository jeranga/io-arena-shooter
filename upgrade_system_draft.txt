UPGRADE SYSTEM DRAFT
=====================

RULES RECAP
-----------
* Pick at most 3 Aggressive (weapon) upgrades and 3 Passive upgrades.
* Each upgrade can be taken up to Level 5.
* When an Aggressive upgrade *and* its paired Passive both reach Level 5, that weapon unlocks its Legendary tier. ( the legendary weapon upgrade should appear next level up)
* Passives apply to all weapons, but only one pairing unlocks a Legendary.
* Numbers are starting points; balance through play‑testing.

DESIGN NOTES
------------
* Build variety: 6 options per category, only 3 slots, promotes specialisation.
* Legendary gating: requires commitment; no mid‑match weapon swapping for maximal form.
* Global passives: every weapon benefits, but only one reaches Legendary.
* Balance levers: adjust cooldown and damage values based on PvP time‑to‑kill data.
